**QSFit** (Quasar Spectral Fitting) is a software package written in
IDL to automatically perform the analysis of Active Galactic Nuclei
(AGN) optical spectra. The software provides estimates of: AGN
continuum luminosities and slopes at several restframe wavelengths;
luminosities, widths and velocity offsets of 20 emission lines
(Halpha, Hbeta, Mgii, [Oiii], Civ, etc.); luminosities of iron blended
lines at optical and UV wavelengths; host galaxy luminosities at 5500A
(for sources with z . 0.8).  The ultimate purpose of **QSFit** is to
allow astronomers to run standardized recipes to analyze the AGN data,
in a simple, replicable and shareable way. The whole fitting process
is customizable for specific needs, and can be extended to analyze
spectra from other data sources.
