- Nov 02, 2017  (ver. 1.2.2)
	+ QSFit is now able to read data from an ASCII text file (rather
	than from a SDSS DR10 FITS file): simply pass the `input='ASCII``
	keyword to `qsfit`;

- Jul 20, 2017  (ver. 1.2.1)
	+ QSFit is now able to fit a set of (manually added) absorption
	lines.  The list of absorption wavelengths must be specified
	through the !QSFIT_OPT.abslines_wavelengths global variable.

- Jul 19, 2017  (ver. 1.2)

	+ QSFit now defines a global variable upon initialization, named
	`!QSFIT_OPT`, containing several settings to customize the fitting
	behavior.  Check the qsfit_prepare_options for further details;

	+ The default host galaxy template is now SWIRE_ELL5
	(http://www.iasf-milano.inaf.it/~polletta/templates/swire_templates.html);

	+ By default, the continuum is now modeled with a single power law
	instead of a smoothly broken power law.  To restore the old
	behaviour set `continuum.dalpha.fixed = 0`;

	+ The four parts of the UV iron template are now joined in a
	single component;

	+ QSFit now estimates the equivalent widths for the iron and
	emission line components;

	+ A Monte Carlo resampling method has been implemented to
	accurately estimate the parameter uncertainties.  See the
	corresponding section in the reference paper;

	+ A new component to model the Balmer continuum and
	pseudo-continuum (blending of high order Balmer lines) has been
	added.


- May 29, 2017  (ver. 1.1)
	Minor updates to improve performances, accuracy of results and
	functionalities:

	+ QSFit: initial value for the continuum component slope is now
	-1.5 (in ver. 1.0 was -2);

	+ QSFit: emission lines rest frame wavelengths have been
	corrected;

	+ QSFit: solved the error occurring when the number of "unknown"
	emission lines was 0;

	+ QSFit components sbpowerlaw and emline: improved performances;

	+ Default gnuplot terminal is qt (in ver. 1.0 was wxt);

	First commit of QSFit package
